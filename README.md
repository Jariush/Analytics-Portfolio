# Jarius Hamid Analytics Portfolio
## About Me!

Hello! My name is Jarius and I am a Master’s in Analytics graduate from Florida Gulf Coast University, with a bachelor’s degree in Economics. I have a deep passion for research and data analysis. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have applied statistical techniques, modeling, data processing, and visualization to projects such as assessing diabetes risk factors and exploring the correlation between poverty and crime. 

I also have experience as a data analyst at LeeTran. I leverage my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and geospatial analysis to optimize transit operations, improve reporting workflows, and support key transportation planning initiatives aimed at enhancing efficiency and performance.

Below are some of the projects I have worked on!

## Projects


### Forecasting Ridership
**Linear Regression Code:** [Ridership Analysis](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Ridership%20Forecasting/Forecasting%20Ridership%20lm.R) 

**Visualizations:** [Ridership Visualization](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Ridership%20Forecasting/Visualizations.pdf)

**Goal:** Create a ridership forecast model to predict weekly ridership based on historical data and seasonal effects.

**Skills:** data visualization, linear regression, visualizations

**Technology/Libraries:** ggplot, lm, lubridate, dplyr, tidyr

**Results:** The R analysis provides a predicted forecast for the selected weeks.

### Transit Accessibility Analysis

#### *Part 1: Census Tract*

**Census Tract Analysis:** [Census Tract Regression Code](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Regression%20Project/Census-Project.md) 

**Census Tract Analysis Visuals:** [Data Visualizations](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/tree/main/Regression-Visuals) 

**Census Tract Socio-Economic Visuals:** [Exploratory Visualizations](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/tree/main/Census-Tract%20Visuals)

#### *Part 2: On-TIme Performance*

**On-Time Performance Analysis:** [OTP Regression Code](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Regression%20Project/OTP-Analysis.md)

**On-Time Performance Visuals:** [Data Visualizations](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/tree/main/OTP%20Visualizations)

**Research Paper:** [Comprehensive Research Paper PDF](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Regression%20Project/Hamid_LeeTran%20Case%20Study.pdf)

**Goal:** Examine the impact of transit accessibility on local communities, with a focus on underprivileged areas. This analysis covers LeeTran's route performance and the socio-economic factors, especially median household income, influencing bus stop placement. The objective is to evaluate daily on-time performance (OTP) and propose data-driven solutions for enhancing public transit services, particularly for low-income communities.

**Skills:** data visualization, linear regression, cross-sectional analysis, R, transit analysis

**Technology/Libraries:** R(ggplot, lm, lubridate, dplyr, tidyr, grid, psych. etc)

**Results:** The analysis includes a detailed review of LeeTran’s daily OTP and identifies socio-economic factors that influence transit accessibility. Proposals are made for improving service in underserved communities.

### Ridership Information System
**Javascript Code:** [Javascript Code for Google AppScript](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Ridership%20Information%20System/add%20rider.gs)

**Dashboard:** [Sample Dashboard](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Ridership%20Information%20System/Ridership%20Dashboard.png)

**Goal:** Engineer a rider tracking system for the seasonal beach route, with a web interface that automates rider count logging in a google sheet. This eliminates manual data entry errors, reduces time spent on data input, and connects the system to a live dashboard for real-time monitoring.

**Skills:** information systems, dashboard creation, KPI tracking, process improvement

**Technology/Libraries:** LookerStudio, GoogleAppScript, Javascript, HTML 

**Results:** The system successfully automates rider count data collection for routes that lack fareboxes or automated count systems, providing real-time insights into ridership trends.

### Calculating Proximity to Bus Stop 
**Juptyr Notebook Code:** [Proximity to Bus Stop Code](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Distance%20From%20Stop%20Script/Distance-From-Stop.ipynb)

**Goal:** Calculate the distance to the nearest bus stop within each census tract of Lee County, this data was used for my LeeTran Accessibility Project.

**Skills:** scripting, data manipulation

**Technology/Libraries:** python (pandas, geopy) 

**Results:** The script calculates and updates a dataset with the distance to the nearest bus stop for each census tract.
